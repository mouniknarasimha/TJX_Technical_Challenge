# TJX_Technical_Challenge


Created Two Projects

	1. **TJX_API** - An ASP.NET Core RESTful api which connects to Database and pull off the results in a JSON output
	2. **TJX_WEB_UI** - An ASP.NET MVC application to call the API and display the JSON response in the UI
	
Created a TJX Database with three tables (Products, Country, Currency) and a stored procedure (GetProductsWithCountryCode)


Note: Updated the solution properties to run the multiple startup projects to test the code, request to update the database connection string for the TJX_API at the appsettings.json
